              Pap sits on the swing in his creased and ironed jeans with a white
              t-shirt and white sneakers, rocking to and fro, bending his knees
              and keeping the ball of his foot on the ground. He holds his
              caramel-colored coffee mug on his thigh.

              The plastic strands of outdoor carpet begin to leave itchy indents
              on the back of your thighs. You trace your pointer finger over
              their variously brown blades, sometimes imagining it is a giant
              forging a path in a tall field. It traces its way to the rubbery
              border of another outdoor rug, a brief smooth respite on this
              journey through fiber thickets. The rolls of black fiber on the
              thicker, smaller black rug create crop lines in its sleeping
              field, firm mounds like the ones you see from the car window on
              the drive home.

              Your aunt sits in her wicker rocking chair, cane leaning against
              the wall behind her. She usually wears a knit cardigan or maybe a
              crew neck sweatshirt, sometimes with her ((light tan) straw hat
              when her hair was thinning from chemo. She holds her right arm in
              her lap stiffly but scratches and pats Leo happily with her left.

              Most of you is trying to disappear into the flower-patterned couch
              and block everything out or maybe just run out the door into the
              cold and down the porch stairs with a tumble.

              It is filled with canning jars and stovetop pressure cookers,
              plain hand-made shelves with store-bought canned goods and your
              auntâ€™s mountain bike. The painted wooden stairs are covered in cut
              patches of textured rubber for safety.

                Pap pulls the chain and the rectangular light suspended over the
                workbench flickers and hums to life. He drags a tall, dusty
                metal Cosco stepstool splattered with old paint over to the
                bench top and pats the seat, telling you to hop up there.
              </p>
              <p>
                You climb up hesitantly, because you are excited to be with pap
                but nervous, too, because you are rarely in the basement. You
                look down at your the small pink scrap of card stock in your
                hand, a commemorative seal printed on the front in black ink.
              </p>
              <p>
                you run your fingers over the ticket stub while pap opens
                drawers and pokes around, assembling an iron and a towel and
                some other stuff. He hands you a pen to write your name and the
                date on the back before he places it in a bunch of layers.
                Slowly rubbing the iron over it, he explains that now you will
                be able to remember the adventure you had with your aunt and
                uncle today and it will stay safe.
