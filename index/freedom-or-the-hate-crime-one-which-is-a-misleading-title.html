      I'm afraid to walk to the store. But I need potatoes. I can't live my life
      in such deep fear and anxiety. Holing myself up probably isn't the real
      solution, which sucks. I'm just so terrified of life now. I feel tired and
      in pain. Just the good old existential ache, the compressed anxiety
      screaming muffled beneath my floorboards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just a tiny <i>snap</i> under your feet, bending and stretching in slow
      motion, until it can no longer withstand the pressure. Suddenly the ground
      gives way beneath you, and you're falling endlessly into a void and a
      not-void, never to feel ground again. Except you are sitting in your home
      office chair in your blanket cave, terrified of having peripheral vision.
    </p>

    <p>Here in a box it is safe and quiet.</p>

    <p>
      I must always watch my back when I leave the house. But here in this hole
      while I am falling, I stare only straight ahead while everything hangs
      weightlessly around me. I sit inside and watch 11-hour videos of streams
      instead of walking to the park. My world becomes smaller but it's all
      good, honestly. Sure, I'm sad, but it's safer in here, and I don't have to
      wear pants.
    </p>

    <p>
      In other ways, I'd rather it just happens and get it over with.
      Statistically the more often you leave the house, the more likely you are
      to be killed in a hate crime, I bet. I actually don't even know if that's
      true. But if everyone else can choose to base their life around their
      unfounded beliefs, then so can I, goddamnit. Anyway, we all know I would
      much rather die in the hate crime than survive it. I have all these
      feelings and guilt and depression, dude, you should just kill me. I'll be
      so pissed if I survive my hate crime, dude.

    <p>
      There's really just nowhere else to go after you make a joke about your
      own hate-crime-death, I guess.

      This is that fucking edgy truth that you freedom motherfuckers are like,
      <i>so</i> into. I'm here telling you to bring your hammers and guns and
      crowbars to my house, to come punish me for either wearing or not wearing
      a mask, for being too sexy or too prudish, for being an imported product
      and for calling it that, for daring to have ancestors, for being so good
      at English but not nearly grateful enough. Come, drench me in blood as
      though I personally created a novel virus and ignored all health and
      safety protocols designed to prevent its spread. Come, light me aflame in
      the middle of the yard while families sob for the deaths of their elders
      outside of hospital doors.
    </p>

    <p>Come do it. <i>Come here</i>.</p>
