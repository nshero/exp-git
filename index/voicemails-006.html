      <b><u>voicemails (006)</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I hated talking on the phone, and really the only people who called me
      were my parents (and spammers). So they went to voicemail. Constantly.
      After years of having a mother who would, on some occasions, call me
      upwards of four times a day, I had finally tried to set a few boundaries.
      Then I let them grow taller and taller. When I resolved to stop answering
      so many phone calls, I couldn't tell if their need was increasing or if my
      desire for freedom and self-determination was growing, or both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, I saved almost every voicemail my parents have left me since
      2016. I've left most of them unheard. I would let them fill up my inbox
      until they couldn't leave any more messages. And eventually, I would have
      to siphon them out of my phone onto an external drive, saved with their
      date and time.

      Transferring them was a simple but unnecessarily long process for me, a
      ritual of grief and self-hatred begun many years before I started the
      archiving project. I felt so horrible about putting space between my
      parents and I, about letting the space get larger as their needs grew. Not
      answering the phone every time had been one of my first and more decisive
      steps in trying to learn how to separate myself, but I still retained the
      evidence of the distance it created. I could measure the space between us
      in the gaps on the call log.

      Almost everyone else in my life tends to think of the archiving as
      healing, and I'm mildly convinced due to their assuredness. But there is
      something about reliving all the pain I thought I had packed away neatly
      that, I must say, feels quite contradictory to that claim. That, and my
      pattern of creating internal emotional turmoil as self-punishment.

      Is it more healing to keep these voicemails, or to delete them unheard? Is
      it more harmful or healing to imagine the changes in my parents' voices
      and words as the years moved on, not knowing if I'll ever be strong enough
      to listen to them? Was it more harmful or healing to move away, to let
      myself be an adult, to abandon my parents when they needed me most, to let
      their voicemails pile up and have to scrape them out of the guts of my
      phone?
