      Okay. It's four in the morning. I'm sitting in a dark kitchen at my
      parents' house, at my place at the kitchen table. I woke up naturally at
      this time, not according to my parents' classic alarm. They have the same
      alarm clock everyone in the United States seems to have in the 90's, a
      digital alarm clock/radio with smooth, diagonal pill-like buttons and a
      strip of faux-wood finish stickered onto the top. Mom is asleep in bed,
      curled on her side and clutching pillows to her ears that she uses to
      drown out my father's snores. Dad is dressed for work and pouring coffee,
      and I can see his outline shadowed from the light behind him illuminating
      the sink. Our oval reproduction print of DaVinci's <i>Last Supper</i> with
      its faux bark edges hangs on the wall above his head. He sits down at his
      spot at the table beside the fridge. We eat cereal together but I don't
      remember if we talk or not, or what about. What conversation does a
      four-year-old have with her father? They're probably the richest, most
      genuine conversations that my father and I ever had.
    </p>

    <p>
      After we eat, Dad kisses me goodbye and leaves for work. I crawl into my
      parents bed next to my mom. I hear the garage door open, filling the house
      with its creaky mechanical droning as Dad starts the Jeep. It is probably
      the tan Jeep. (Later they will have to perform some sleight of hand when
      they trade the tan Jeep in for the maroon one because I am so attached to
      it. The safety of items: Within a few hours of landing in America as a
      baby, I was photographed sound asleep in the back of the tan Jeep.) The
      garage door rumbles shut and I hear the Jeep drive down the hill as Dad
      drives off to open the restaurant he manages.

      I lay awake I watch the numbers change on the clock I cry I pray
      desperately to God to protect my father because I am terrified that
      something will happen to him. My heart hurts inside my chest in the same
      kind of way I feel later for my student teachers at the end of the
      semester. The ache flows slowly down my arm, my fingers becoming a
      dendritic extension of the soreness in my chest. I miss him and I am
      scared now that he is gone. I cry silently in the dark, unsure if I will
      ever sleep again, and after a ten-minute year, I usually do.

      A child's eternity later, maybe a couple of years, I have a nightmare
      roughly shaped like the story of Hansel and Gretel, but my father is
      Hansel and our house is the witch's house. Trapped between the roaring
      hearth surrounding her cauldron and the door, I try to save my
      Hansel-father from the witch's grasp, and in the process, somehow, the
      house catches fire. For at least a year after I wake up, I am terrified of
      our house lighting aflame, carefully choosing which toys and objects I
      must Protect each time I leave.

      When Mom and I walk to the library, I imagine us returning, horrified, to
      our house burning, the enormity of our situation evading our eyesight
      until we hit the nadir of the block and begin climbing the big hill. At
      night, I dream of escaping a billowing cloud of smoke in our house on my
      hands and knees, then standing underneath the tree in the neighbor's yard
      while the orange and red light from the flames illuminates my face. I
      cannot explain to my parents, impatiently waiting downstairs for me to put
      my shoes on to go to the store, that I feel like I am making a life and
      death decision every time I leave the house. I already know that's silly,
      somehow. I don't know how to translate it into words, anyway. Eventually
      the fear fades away, but I can't remember when or how. Maybe it morphs
      into something else.

      By fourth grade, I attend a small elementary school, small enough where
      every student knows almost every other student's name. One day we are told
      that a sixth grader named Leah passed away from cancer, and we hold a
      ceremony for her outside around a tree on the playground. Our music
      teacher directs us as we sing "Amazing Grace." Leah lived in a smaller
      town nearby and was friends with my classmate's sister. She rarely spoke
      when we all hung out in the bus room every day, seated crosslegged on the
      carpet in clusters, but she giggled shyly while the louder kids played out
      their antics. I have experienced a few deaths by now, but they were the
      expected passings of older adults with terminal ailments--not a kid I saw
      every day, even if we weren't friends.

      When I see my mother after school, I am actively hostile towards her,
      unable to contain the fact of my emotions even if I don't know what they
      are. I stomp home and hide under the basement stairs amongst my crates of
      toys, rubbing my palms on the nubby texture of the low-pile carpet over
      and over until they feel alien. When I tell Mom later about Leah's death,
      she is sympathetic and kind, but comfort still evades me. It's like she
      doesn't really understand what happened. As an adult, I understand why her
      reaction to uncertainty tends to be toxic positivity, but as a child, I
      don't know why it grates so irritatingly against my distress. By the time
      Dad gets home from work, it's like nothing even happened at all, my
      emotions properly settled and smoothed over as best as a nine-year-old
      can.

      It is Christmas Eve. I am eighteen years old, and we are recently home
      from celebrating at our relatives' houses. Mom and I are awake later than
      normal; typically she would be in bed by nine at the latest. She is
      freshly bathed; the Christmas tree lights are on; we sit in the green
      recliners. My calves and feet still tingle from having recently removed
      hosiery, a sensation that, at the time, feels highly specific to holidays.
      Dad decided at last minute to attend midnight mass, his second Catholic
      service of the day, marking a year and a half since his quadruple bypass
      surgery. In the future as I write this I'll be working so hard to pull
      this conversation back from the recesses of my brain, unable to properly
      contain and scale my weeks-long effort to its relative unimportance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the living room that Christmas Eve, my mother and I speculate on Dad's
      religious commitment and recent, discordant personality changes as
      something builds inside me. I can't tell if it's better to carry this
      weight myself, or to provide my mother with its simultaneous gift and
      burden. If it's even real, or simply a self-imposed haunting. My
      deliberations over exactly how much to reveal to my parents is a running
      theme by now: The previous night, I begged the nebulous void of the
      universe for help in an anonymous and unread online journal, finally
      admitting to myself that my secret depression had returned and that I
      wasn't sure what to do about it. I am, in the past and in the present, in
      a constant cycle of silent destruction and repair of my relationship with
      myself, of trusting my own thoughts and emotions, of accepting that I even
      exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know why; I just have this weird feeling that maybe this is our
      last Christmas together," I say, or something like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like rubbing greasy fingers all over part of a VHS tape ribbon, I don't
      remember her ultimate response. I think she asked me about it, kind of
      anxiously, but calmed herself while I extrapolated upon my intrusive fears
      of death. As was our pattern, I was not fully soothed by her reassurances.
      I trusted the sharp fears in my heart much more than I trusted her words.
      At the time, neither my mother nor I see the premonition for what it
      really is: a manifestation of my lifelong anxiety; a statement of
      inevitability; a convergence of inheritances and the power of believing in
      them, for better or worse.

      [I THINK I NEED TO KIND OF AMP UP A LITTLE BIT HOW THIS FEELING FEELS
      OUTSIDE OF MYSELF, THAT I WONDER IF IT IS A PREMONITION OR SUPERSTITIOUS
      GIFT, THAT MY ANXIETY MANIFESTS AS SUPERSTITION AND OCD]
