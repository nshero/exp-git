      Sometimes it's weird to remember being a really happy, well-loved kid but
      then also retroactively identify with so much textbook unhappiness. Can
      both be true? It kind of feels like an expanding sentence:

            Okay, well this one time when I was twelve my parents went to this
            hillbilly fortune teller who chain smoked and told fortunes out of
            her house using a deck of regular playing cards. Then they told me
            that she said I'd turn out to be just like my abusive and
            narcissistic grandmother but other than that pretty good,
            considering.

      How old were you when you realized your family is bad? How do I keep
      myself from becoming Barb? Maybe it is best if I stay alone, curled up in
      the corner on my spider web. I simply cannot be a normal healthy person. I
      am not meant to be a part of others’ lives. How do I stop the selfish and
      fucked-up kneejerk reaction in the first place? Can I trace it back to the
      nerve ending, to the chemical stimulation that provides a tiny electrical
      zap deep in the curls of my grey matter or white matter or whatever, and
      excise the very neuron that activates?

      I frequently wish I could erase something, usually myself but sometimes
      also my family, at its very source. Can I locate and pull the right strand
      of DNA to collapse the whole bloodline of a family that does not share my
      blood? Surely, there must be a hairline vein into which I can smoothly
      insert a wire to strip the whole thing out. Pull the tiniest plug to
      instigate a full-scale collapse. Not even a collapse, but an inversion,
      rendering impossible the feeling of loss. How can you lose something you
      had never even imagined quietly in your brain-space?

      Paul called this morning and I couldn't help but tell him that I saw Barb.
      "You saw her and you didn't talk to her?" He asked me, and something in
      his voice told me that he was having a hard time imagining seeing a family
      member and not saying a word to them. But it's easy, you see. I've been
      working to avoid these landmines my whole life.
    </p>

    <p>
      I told him that Barb may try to sabotage Pap's interview. And that if she
      does, then that's it. There's not much I can do and that’s just what it’s
      like to be her grandchild.

      After Pap died, I mostly felt glad that he was finally free of her, and
      anxious about having to see her again. We were walking out of the banquet
      room when I heard her call my name. I looked up and she stood there with
      her ghost white hair. she held me by my forearms and looked imploringly at
      me, like I was going to forgive her or pity her or give her a glimmer of
      something. It felt a little like the time she told me she missed me.

      “Hi Gram,” I said distantly but my eyes were welling. I think she asked
      how I was doing and I said, "I'm fine," but started crying. She muttered
      something about it being hard, and I said I had to go. I walked out of the
      restaurant and Tyler followed me out.

      I still don't know what I'm supposed to do with all of these memories. I
      won't just be shuffling them off to my child because I do not wish to have
      a child. It's weird to think that our family will essentially end once I
      die. But for millions of years, various people have been a "dead end" on
      their family tree, for so many reasons. It feels a lot better to think of
      it that way, that I'm just one little twig amongst millions through the
      years, that happened to snap off of the tree just like millions of others.
      If you believe in that one multiverse theory there is already another
      universe where you have many children.

      I had a conversation recently about being the one holding the memories,
      about legacy. About being left standing by myself, holding this heavy and
      unwieldy cardboard box that looks like it's been beat to shit over the
      years. And I can't just put it down or throw it out. But what the fuck
      else am I supposed to do with it? Who am I supposed to give my old photos
      to? Build a whole family tree just to burn it down.
