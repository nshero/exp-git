      "I want to spend my time living life instead of recording it," I wrote as
      a college student, several times in my journals. In some ways the
      archiving project is relatively young, a living tantrum suffering through
      its terrible twos. Naturally, however, the sort of person who might embark
      on such a deranged project later is likely to discover that she has been
      recording all along in different ways, imprinting moments by slipping
      small pebbles into her pockets while watching a particularly sweet sunset.
      Imagining how I might film a moment of riding on the highways to our
      family's hunting camp up north, car winding up and around forested hills
      and down into a cool shaded valley, with Jewel crooning out of my
      headphones as I held my CD player on my lap, holding it up carefully when
      we hit bumpy patches of gravel to avoid skipping.

      Maybe this is why I have been marking my father's decline in so many ways,
      from furtive photographs in his hospital room to audio-recording his
      specialist visits. To me it became a natural evolution as time
      progressed-- starting first for the necessity of preserving his health,
      turned and expanded as we moved beyond the point of saving his life.
      Before his cardiologist or nephrologist said "There's nothing more we can
      do for you;" before they said it again and again. We could never save his
      life; so what was I preserving in the meantime?

      As the vascular dementia set in, he could barely remember what his doctor
      had told him at the appointment that morning to relay to my mother over
      the dinner table. Mom started trying to join him but it didn't always
      help: they would both attend an appointment, both listen to the exact same
      advice from the provider, then argue over what they heard for the next six
      months. For a few years we would go all three, or I would join when Mom
      ran out of sick days.
