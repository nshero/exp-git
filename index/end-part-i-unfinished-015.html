    <p>Mom sent me a text message on Sunday as I was making dinner. "Dad got worse and ask me to schedule meeting
        tomorrow with
        hospice." Then, an hour later, "Called hospice sending someone out asap . Night"</p>
    <p>I put my phone down on the counter and closed my eyes. True to form, I did not send a message in response.</p>
