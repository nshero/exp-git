      I like to let myself roam freely with the archive project, especially when
      I'm doing the things I don't want to do. Everyone asks: Why save the
      things you don't want to save? I wish I knew. I have to save my father's
      medical records because... because this was one of the ways I checked in
      on my parents? Because I mostly viewed my father as his illness (both
      unfair and unsurprising)?
    </p>

      I find a rhythm, just like I used to do for assembling patient packets or
      making copies or data entry. Open, open, close, close. Download every
      encounter that Dad had with the medical system that they'll let me access
      online. Save the contextless numbers and abbreviations recording the
      tumultuous decline of a human body, pages of lab results that feel as
      empty and inscrutable as the reasons for doing this weird shit.

      I alternate between letting the shutters of my heart hang open in pain and
      feeling the surprising calm of roteness fall over me as I move backwards
      in time. Open, open, close, close. Maybe I should try to rush through some
      of these more acutely painful activities like ripping off a band-aid. Work
      to focus intently on this part no matter how difficult it feels, no matter
      how much my heart is itching to get up and walk around to protect itself.
      Because there are still a lot of lab results to download and it can't take
      forever. Or can it?

      Open, open, close, close. The number of days between progress notes grows
      larger as I rewind, opening into weeks and months of gaps. That was the
      time when Dad was living his life, I remind myself. I imagine him washing
      the car in the driveway, radio set to WKYE 95.5FM.
