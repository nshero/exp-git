        <b><u>unremarkable</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
    <p>Trash girl in her trash office being a pile of trash. There are stink lines that radiate out of my heart. Fuck
        having
        anything mineable, fuck creating a nice string of words that are supposed to poignantly encapsulate some perfect
        victimized pain. I still can't understand how I am both:  I am a dark evil soul who can do nothing wrong. I am a
        perfect
        angel flattened on the underside of my own tires. I always want to be so blameless and perfect. I want to be
        constantly
        soothed, to forever rub a gentle beeswax balm on my chapped little ass. I'm a living tantrum, a spoiled brat,
        living in
        a haze staring at my own dusty-ass navel through a microscope.</p>

    <p>What if it's as simple as:  If you are told something as a child, you tend to believe it. You are a special
        little
        cupcake; you are a worthless piece of trash; you’ll turn out to be just like your father. It’s hard to wrap
        one's head
        around being a whole human who is also only a bit of flesh blending into the rest of the mass of humanity, all
        tumbling
        forth in its aimlessness. It turns out our fates are merely statistical probabilities: of developing any given
        illness
        or injury; of experiencing any number of life’s inconveniences or joys or horrors.</p>

    <p>People want to read stories of those who succeeded, who went through something and beat it, not of someone who
        fails
        miserably, constantly thwarted by herself in the most mundane and stupid ways possible. Not the story of someone
        so
        boring she refuses to even have a story, holed up inside her heart and her bed for fear of the next Thing.</p>

    <p>I'm tired of judging my life as trauma or not, as mental illness or not, as useful or not, as privileged or not,
        as
        singular or not, as universal or not, as worthwhile or not. I could sit here and peel my whole brain apart,
        trying to
        find a whole I could only perceive by forgetting about my brain entirely.</p>

    <p>I would spend time with Dad and afterwards wonder why he couldn't just behave himself for one goddamn week, why
        everything always had to be a fight for both of them — and therefore all of us. But his stubborn refusal was the
        most
        alive part of this man. For all of the horseshit life threw at him, he still had some level of control over
        himself—
        until he didn't.</p>

    <p>A wrinkled, withered fist in the air, punching aimlessly against the statistics, inevitably becoming a posthumous
        data
        point:  Turns out, if you ignore your doctors your whole life, you may die early.</p>

    <p>Dad's life was unremarkable and so is mine.</p>
