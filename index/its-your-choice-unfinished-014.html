      "You know, Dad, it's your choice about the hospice thing," I said to him
      the morning I left before my aunt arrived to give me a ride back through
      the mountains to the city. "I know Mom's being kinda pushy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat in one of the green reclining chairs and nodded. "Yeah, she's being
      a little pushy." He scratched his brow with a slightly shaking hand, now
      unsteady as his heart disease progressed further and further. He looked at
      the television instead of me. I like to think he knew I preferred it this
      way for this kind of conversation, feeling less like he was ignoring me
      and more like he was sparing me. Maybe some part of his decaying brain and
      heart could understand how closeness was pain, how love is simply the
      other side of loss.

      "I know, but it's your life, you know? You're the only one who can make
      the decision," I said. "I just want you guys to have more help."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm <i>fine</i>," he sighed, like he always did</p>
