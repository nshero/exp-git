      <b><u>collecting you (003)</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>Here is how it feels to collect you:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        like a betrayal of your current self, the you who is not reading this
        right now, the "future you" to whom you wrote as a despairing high
        school sophomore
      </li>
      <li>
        like re-committing my love to you, both in the past and in the present
      </li>
      <li>
        like delaying our reunion. It feels like keeping a secret from you, that
        I love(d) you so fiercely that I want to bring you with me to my
        imaginary escape hatch. In some cases it means that I don't feel
        comfortable reaching out to you in the present until I finish collecting
        your past.
      </li>
      <li>
        like saying goodbye to you again, like mourning your absence, like the
        pain of remembering how much I missed you and how we were supposed to
        escape together
      </li>
      <li>
        like watching a thousand versions of all of the things I have missed in
        the interim -- your weddings; the births of your children; your master's
        degrees; your divorces; the deaths of your parents
      </li>
      <li>
        like constantly forgetting that sometimes people are in one's life for a
        particular amount of time, and you move past one another and diverge
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      My partner is mystified as to why I won't automate this process. By now,
      surely, I would have found an easier way so save your entries that can
      also keep me from another IP ban. Despite the fact that a program is
      smarter and automatically more thorough than I could ever be, more
      complete in every way, and also significantly faster, there is something
      that feels more complete and more secure to do it myself. I want to know
      that I have opened your monthly archives, manually saving your single
      entries in folders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the time I skim lightly over your entries, avoiding reading them
      in order to save time and keep my momentum. I look for links or reasons to
      come back for a more careful review, then I save the file under its
      six-digit number, close out of it, and move on. Even then, I am catching
      enough to follow onto the contours of your life at the time. Besides, even
      in the situations where I am just running a command to pull from the
      Internet Archive, I can't help but take the time to expand all of your
      snapshots, to spend a few hours piecing your past together and
      rememberingâ€”our time together; our time apart.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll always wish for more. Ever the neurotic completionist, I can never
      have enough of you in my repository.
