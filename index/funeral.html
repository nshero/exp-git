    <b><u>funeral</u></b>
  </p>
  <p>
    It was Dad who called to tell me that Pap died, because it was always Dad
    who came to tell me when a family member died. After I looked at the
    transcript of the voicemail, I opened my closet to pull out the dress I
    had picked out a week ago for Dad's funeral, after I had finally gotten up
    the nerve to check on him in the hospital and every word of his came out
    as a desperate gasp, halting and forced as though they could end with a
    terrible groan at any moment. I had hung up the phone with him, took a
    deep breath, and opened my closet to look for something black and wintery.
    Now that I was headed to a slightly different funeral than I had
    originally planned, I couldn't tell if it was more or less morbid to wear
    the same dress, so I spent the next several days trying every combination
    of clothes I had. Now I don't even remember what I wore.

    We were a little late to Pap's funeral, because I was a frenzied anxious
    mess and I couldn't find anything and I looked crazy. Dad was still in the
    hospital; nobody would tell me until later that day that he had been up
    since three puking copious amounts of blood. I couldn't figure out where
    the ground was. I anxiously bounced my leg in the car and checked the time
    on my phone while we wound around the mountains, ending in the
    all-too-familiar series of hills leading into my parents hometown.

    My mother texted to tell me that they were waiting to start until we
    walked in, which obviously made me feel way better. Everyone was waiting
    for us. I walked into the same funeral home that had hosted and buried the
    rest of my family members. I first entered that old, converted mansion as
    a baby, carried in my parents arms, for my paternal grandmother's passing.
    A few years later, I walked into the foyer on my own two feet, clutching
    to my mother's leg, for my paternal grandfather, a terrifying man in
    decline as long as I had been alive. I sat in their upstairs kitchen,
    waiting for coffee to brew as a pre-teen when my aunt passed from brain
    cancer. I don't even remember the countless others in between, great aunts
    or uncles, cousins twice-removed, or whatever.

    The funeral home was a family business, as I think many of them are, at
    least in small towns around here. Tim knew us pretty well; he inquired
    politely about my Dad and wished us the best for him. Months later, Tim
    would be the one to acquire us a Steelers-themed urn for Dad after a
    last-minute call from my aunt, even though he wasn't the one directing
    Dad's service.

    Pap had the weirdest Catholic funeral service I've been to in my life, and
    like, I've been to a fair number of funerals. We held a short kind-of
    mass, with no Eucharist (is that common in funerals, maybe it's newer?),
    held directly in the funeral home. I checked my watch and it had been
    about seven minutes-- or maybe thirteen, but I'm just saying it wasn't
    even close to twenty. As one might expect, Barb isn't particularly devout.

    We stood in line to kneel at the portable kneeler in front of the glass
    table holding the wooden box with Pap's ashes. When it was my turn I
    kneeled and paused for a second--I never understand how long I'm supposed to
    take at these things. Then I touched the box and whispered, "I'm sorry,
    Pap," and I got up.

    At the time I wasn't sure what I was apologizing for, probably for not
    being able to stay in touch with him, for feeling like a bad grandkid and
    a failure, like I always do, or if it was that he had to be with Barb for
    all of those years, or all of it. I understand now, mostly, that Bob was
    culpable for his own life, that he had plenty of opportunities and power
    to change things, or at the very least not bring
    <em>six motherfucking children and their resulting generations</em> into
    his mess. But for most of my life, Pap was safe, patient, quiet, and
    soothing. He was a saint for following all of Barb's barking demands, for
    tolerating her verbal abuse day in and day out, driving her around
    wherever she wanted, for caring for Kathy after she was diagnosed with
    brain cancer, for being noticeably less bad than the absolute worst.
