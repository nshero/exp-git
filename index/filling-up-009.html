  <body><p><b><u>filling up (009)</u></b></p>
<p>This was the shape of my parents' lives:</p>
<p><u>169 lb, 6oz</u></p>
<p>We begin when Dad comes home from his most recent stay in the hospital or Emergency Department visit. Even at his best, fresh and shiny with a new band-aid--sometimes metaphorical, sometimes literal-- to tide him over to the next visit, the man is having a rough time. He can't remember what happened this morning as he sits in front of the television. I project the ghost of his father onto him while he sits in his chair, remembering my grandfather tethered to his chair when I was a toddler: The oxygen hums loudly and he has to turn the TV up to hear it.</p>
<p><u>171 lb</u></p>
<p>He weighs himself every morning as directed by his physician; the telemedicine scale has a soothing robotic voice that announces the results once it settles on a number. Dad writes his weight and blood pressure down in the appropriate square on the monthly calendar hanging on the fridge. The April spread, sponsored by a local funeral home, features St. Catherine of Siena, a woman who refused to marry because she was so dedicated to her family-- or that's what she told them, anyhow.</p>
<p><u></u>174 lb, 4oz</u></p>
<p>Steadily he gains weight as the fluid builds up in his chest cavity and begins constricting his organs. Alone at the house, he drives himself to his physical therapy appointment when the aging services van doesn't come. Dad can't remember all of the questions he was supposed to ask the doctor and he forgot his notes. He makes a list every day of tasks to keep himself busy. Years ago, he oversaw fifteen restaurants and their respective problems, and now he's not sure if he's supposed to go grocery shopping later. His last job was in the university kitchen and he kept showing up even after he was fired, determined to keep checking the temperatures of the walk-ins.</p>
<p><u></u>175 lb, 2 oz</u></p>
<p>On his way home, Dad decides to stop at the gas station to refill his tires with air. He gets stuck on all fours on the ground, trying to catch his breath enough to get back up. He wonders how he got this way, knowing the answer full well in his bone marrow, I'm sure. I wonder if he curses God or his own father or both as he sweats and puffs alone on the gasoline-streaked cement.</p>
<p><u></u>176 lb, 2 oz</u></p>
<p>The differing versions all lead to the same result:</p>
<p>Dad falls in the hallway and slices his leg open from knee to ankle. Dad is outside sprawled in the front yard, unable to breathe as he tries to walk back from the mailbox. The neighbors spy out their front window so often their blinds are dented and crooked, but they do not come out to ask him if he needs help. It's midnight and Dad's oxygen levels are so low that he is wildly disoriented and trying to use his Portable Oxygen Concentrator as a toilet. Dad is at a doctor's appointment and after taking his vitals they ask him to go directly to the Emergency Department instead.</p>
<p><u>174 lb, 8 oz</u></p>
<p>Mom's FMLA request gets denied by the school district. Mom is thinking about the time she almost escaped with the neighbor. Mom visits Dad at the hospital every day after work until he is discharged. Mom tries to project her pain onto her friends and siblings to spare her daughter. Mom's own mother hangs up on her regularly.</p>
<p><u>173 lb, 8 oz</u></p>
<p>There's no longer anything the doctors can do, really. Sometimes they'll run some Bumex to help dissolve the fluid in his chest or clean him up if he gets cut. But his organs are so damaged that their calibration is a careful balance--best not to rock the boat much. No more stopgaps: just wait until he quits puking blood, then send him back home.</p>
<p>As the cycles continue they also distort, like when I would put silly putty on a newspaper to transfer the image and then stretch it beyond recognition. I knew what it used to look like, even had a copy of the original image to compare, but couldn't remember which specific contortions I performed to get it that way. Repair and restoration feel depressingly impossible. The same cycle with different clothes on plays out simultaneously all across the western part of the state as their own microcosms; the universes of brokenness in my relatives' households map out to their own fucked up constellations bearing the surname of my forefathers.</p>
