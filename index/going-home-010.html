      Mom texted on the Wednesday after Easter. My father was back in the
      hospital from another heart attack. They needed help, more than I could
      give. I had been avoiding letting myself be subsumed by my parents' need
      for years, hating myself deeply the whole time. I knew I could give them
      my whole life and it would still never be enough, and I just wasn't quite
      willing to do that. I couldn't figure out how to be helpful and still be
      my own person, how to just talk on the phone for more than five minutes
      while still hiding everything I was thinking about, doing, being. It felt
      like all or nothing. It still does.

    <p>
      So I went home for the week, sleeping in my aunt's basement instead of in
      my childhood bedroom next to my parents' room. My mother had been sleeping
      in my old room for a year or so anyway. I was afraid of being at the house
      at night, of hearing my parents fall or puke or fight or fuck, or die. I
      knew that nighttime was when shit went down, when Dad was at his worst and
      things were the hardest. My guilt over leaving my mother to deal with it
      herself pressed into me, but my desperate, trembling, lifelong fear of my
      father's death won out.
      <em>To be able to take care of them you have to be able to function,</em>
      I thought, and arranged my escape plan. I emailed my friends to tell them
      I was home and that I would need them to text me videos of cute animals
      sporadically.

    <p>
      We spent the week as a family both trying to "discuss" hospice and trying
      not to. Dad was asking everyone he could think of what their opinion was.
      He was waiting for his priest to return his call. Dad didn't feel ready to
      die yet, and he knew that hospice would mean a very quick road to his
      death, a fact neither my mother nor I truly understood in the same way.
      (How could we?) Mom was desperate for their misery to end, crying out for
      the kind of help that would require a whole staff of people and then some.
      She couldn't do this anymore. She was furious with Dad's siblings for
      telling him at the hospital that they didn't think he was ready for
      hospice. They weren't there cleaning up his dirty diapers or calling 911
      in the middle of the night. They didn't have to find someone to rescue him
      from the woods when he stubbornly proclaimed he would still go hunting.

      I felt the familiar strain of being put between them, as I had repeatedly
      been, sometimes over the dumbest shit imaginable, for the past fifteen
      years. They looked at me over the kitchen table, awaiting my verdict like
      I had the authority of a judge who could also predict the future. I
      created this problem for myself, I realized, assuming their pattern of
      relying on me for arbitration because I was willing to do it as a teen and
      twenty-something, but it still felt very unfair to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I said what was true, because despite all of my lies to my parents
      about who I was and how okay I was, I always accidentally told them so
      much more truth than I intended, always felt backed into a corner when
      talking to them: "Medically, you are absolutely ready for hospice and
      there is no question about it. Emotionally and mentally, you are not
      ready. You can't make the decision to do it until you can accept that it's
      time." I stabbed at the food on my plate. â€œYou better GET ready, real
      goddamn quick."
    </p>

    <p>
      I felt satisfied that I had disappointed both of them pretty equally with
      my answer, refusing to truly take a side when they wanted it most. I did
      not wish to be helpful in this decision. I couldn't tell who was telling
      the truth about how bad things were, but I suspected they were each wrong
      in their own ways. It was a mistake to come home, a wrenching pain vining
      around my heart even in the best moments of the week, but it was also
      unavoidable. I couldn't put these things off any longer. Time to be the
      goddamn fucking adult that I so unwillingly was. And now, it mildly
      assuages my guilt that I was able to at least do this much before
      everything slid away into oblivion.
