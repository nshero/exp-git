    <p>The Visiting Nurses would remind Dad multiple times in a visit that he had to wear his oxygen continuously. If
        his O2
        sats hit below 90, he needed to put his cannula back in immediately to prevent yet another heart attack. I typed
        away on
        my phone, trying to record everything to tell my mother via text message while she worked. Dad would nod and
        say, "oh
        yeah, no problem," and tell them a mixture of truth and lies about his abilities, health, and habits right in
        front of
        me, the stupid asshole. Once I poked the nurse's arm and showed her my phone screen behind Dad's back: <i>SOME
            OF THIS IS
            LIES</i>, I had typed out, and shrugged at her with a half-smile. She nodded.</p>

    <p>In between Physical Therapy sessions and Visiting Nurse appointments, Dad was determined to still do everything
        he could
        to live life, just very slowly. Turn off his oxygen and go smoke a cigarette. Try to wipe the floors and do
        laundry. I
        fretted over him, but knew that kind of hovering was what made him resent my mother so much. He was determined
        to mow
        the lawn himself that week, but we both knew he wouldn't be able to do it. I was terrified that he would still
        try.
        "Please, don't make me have to call 911 for you," I begged him, "No ambulance this week." He would look past me
        to the
        TV and shrug.</p>

    <p>After accomplishing his chores for the day, Dad would sleep all afternoon, tuckered out from all the activity,
        his sleep
        machine buzzing loudly. He was dead to the world. It was then that I would go downstairs to the basement and
        work, or
        "work." I checked my personal email on my phone while reading my work email on my laptop. I drank whiskey from
        my hidden
        bottle and vaped weed, trying halfheartedly to get something done.</p>

    <p>I texted Paul that I was convinced that my Dad was going to die while I was alone with him, that I was just
        waiting to
        have to call the ambulance. I hadn't had to call 911 for Dad yet, spared the gruesome closeness of reality by
        sixty
        miles of distance, but I just knew my time had to be coming. This was one of my most pressing fears. Paul
        reminded me to
        breathe. I thought about what might happen if I just lurched out the basement door and kept running forever,
        like I had
        also considered as a depressed, bratty teenager, so desperate to escape that my online moniker at the time
        expressed the
        desire plainly.</p>

    <p><i>Nice</i>, I thought, as I remembered it was April 20, still as childish as ever. The email had arrived first
        thing in the
        morning while I was still at my aunt's, having a cigarette and walking her snorty little pup around the
        neighborhood. I
        reread it several more times throughout the day.</p>

    <p>[Okay this was originally about getting my VONA workshop acceptance the week before Dad died but I'm not sure if
        I'm including VONA in the work or not yet actually]</p>
