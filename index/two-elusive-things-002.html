    <p>Here are two elusive things.</p>

    <ol>

        <p>
          In 1996-1997, I was taught a primary-level cross-disciplinary
          curriculum for "gifted" (cringe) students in a small pull-out program.
          The curriculum implements a frame story that may involve several
          children traveling to a distant land (it may have been another
          country, or perhaps an imaginary dimension) and meeting a girl named
          Zara who wore a Claddagh ring. The program included an audio-cassette
          reading of the story and several accompanying songs, which may have
          centered around common aphorisms like "look before you leap."

        <p>
          Despite all of the "work" from the past year or so, I haven't always
          felt so keen on remembering things. But this is a memory I've been
          missing for a long time. I've been writing about it for twenty years.
          I reminisced in AIM conversations about it that I have saved to this
          day.

        <p>
          I didn't start searching for it in earnest until a few months ago, and
          now I am apparently attempting to make up lost time and opportunity
          with my frenzy. I sought out and contacted the instructor who taught
          this to me so many years ago. I paid for scanned records from the
          school archives. I have been searching through conference proceedings
          and educator periodicals from the early 1990's.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you see some wild-keyboarded poster out there begging and yapping
          about stupid Zara and her ring, I apologize. It's me, and I don't have
          a problem at all.*</p></li>

            <p>
              Once, probably in 2003 or 2004, I was clicking around on personal
              websites and found an incredible art project that combined images
              and pop-up windows and hidden links in image maps and secret text
              in the status bar and IN THE SOURCE CODE with a nonlinear,
              abstract/poetic story, or perhaps collection of essays, or
              whatever they were.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've since come across several websites that do similar incredible
              and wacky things (<a href="http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org" target="_blank">wwwwwwwww.jodi.org</a>, <a href="http://cubertown.neocities.org" target="_blank">cubertown.neocities.org</a>,
              <a href="http://lhohq.info" target="_blank">lhohq.info</a>), but never <i>that</i> one. I don't remember anything about
              the url (other than sometimes even the filenames contained poetic
              text that built upon itself in nesting folders), the creator, the
              name, or even what it was about.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've thought about it many times over the years and have always
              hoped to create something as wild and involved and wonderful. Now
              I want to do all of those tricks and pretend they're mine, but
              they never were. Certainly, I could never make a standard
              early-00's alert window seem so beautiful.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can't remember how I found it. Was it through a graphics
              tutorial website—something like "Touchstone"—and what the fuck was
              <i>that</i> URL?—or maybe through link exchanges like Provance? Or a
              message board like fu.CK? Did I just spend a whole lifetime
              sitting inside, opening commenter link after hostee link after
              affiliate blog, quietly spectating an ever-shifting community,
              until I found it?
            </p>

    </ol>

    <p>
      These memories are too vague to be helpful, but I've been trying so hard
      to regain them, pacing desperately amidst their foggy edges. What are all
      of the things I will never find, and how do I describe them and my search?
      Maybe it's a trick—the harder I look, the more I try to focus on my memory
      to pull more things out, the fuzzier and fuzzier things become. Grasping
      harder only pushes them away.
