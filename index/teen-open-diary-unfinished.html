    <p>I should be telling you about Teen Open Diary.</p>
    <p>
      It's a tale about as old as the Internet itself: A Kid Comes of Age
      Online, for the First Time (And Then At Least Two Or Three Times After
      That)
    </p>
    <p>
      After graduating from our Free Homestead websites where we pasted gifs of
      Scotty puppies bounding from left to right, with our repeating cloud tile
      backgrounds and friend shoutouts in bold and italic Times New Roman or
      maybe Comic Sans, we learned about the online journal in Seventh Grade.
      After bouncing around a few of them, I found myself entranced for years by
      Teen Open Diary, the scrappier, louder, and much more annoying younger
      sibling of the Open Diary website. Born in 1998, Teen Open Diary (TOD)
      afforded each user a free online journal with unlimited entries (?), a
      profile and index page ("Diary Description," or "DD"), and a commenting
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I remember most about the beginning of my "relationship" with TOD is
      that I began visiting the website daily very near to September 11, 2001,
      potentially even that week.

      A website notorious for how many times it eventually was hacked or
      hijacked; a website that, for some reason, let its users customize their
      journals by overriding the javascript and css of the original PHP template
      and injecting any number of images, of animated blinking borders, of
      floating, scrolling DIV boxes, of MIDI and MP3 files of Avril Lavigne or
      Christina Aguilera, custom backgrounds and as always, a
      carefully-decorated custom scrollbar.

      We would immediately work to remove the large, rectangular tie-dyed logo
      emblazoned with "Teen Open Diary" in white impact font with a thick black
      border. By clicking "view" then "source", you could figure out what other
      people pasted in their little white boxes to change the background color
      of the input boxes, or that
